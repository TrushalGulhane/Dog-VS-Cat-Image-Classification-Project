# Dog-VS-Cat-Image-Classification-Project
he Dogs &amp; Cats is a foundational problem for a basic CNN(convolutional neural network) model which involves classifying images as a dog or a cat. The dataset can be used for learning how to develop,evaluate and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for classification of images.
